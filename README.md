# Visualizing America's State Parks
## Exploring America's Natural Wonders: A Comprehensive National Parks Website Project

[View our Website Here!](https://hmmclean.github.io/Data-Visualization-Project_Project-3/WEBSITE/index.html)

# Overview
We started with the idea of building a website to help people determine which of Americaâ€™s national parks to visit. We wanted to show activities, distances, states, directions, and weather. This project aims to create a valuable resource for individuals interested in exploring and learning about the diverse national parks across the United States.

# Repo Navigation 
* Resources
    * Cleaned - CSVs of final cleaned data.
    * Data Sources - JSONs of final cleaned data. These are being hosted on a separate GitHub repo ([Activities](https://github.com/QbicleTKG/activities-data-json-hosting) and [Parks List](https://github.com/QbicleTKG/parks-list-data-json-hosting)).
    * Uncleaned - CSVs of data pulled from the NPS API.
    * NPS_API_Data_Pull - Code used to pull the data from the NPS API.
 * WEBSITE - HTML, JS, and CSS source documentation for our website. 
* Project Rubric - Text file containing the standards for our assignment.
* Data Transformation Jupyter Notebook - main code used for initial data cleaning.
* MongoApp - PyMongo Jupyter Notebook used to provide information on loading cleaned CSVs into MongoDB and JSONifying them.
* Assets - Images belonging to the repo.

# Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading

    </p>


## Extraction 
- We pulled 5 CSVs from the National Park Services API:
   - Activities
   - Fees and Passes
   - Park Activities
   - Parks List
   - Visitors' Centers

## Transform
- After some deliberation as a team and diving into each spreadsheet, we decided to keep only the Activities database and to merge the Fees/Passes and Parks List datasets.

## Load
- Once data cleaning was complete, the data was loaded into MongoDB and JSONified via PyMongo. We chose MongoDB due to the ease with which it can be integrated into Python/Jupyter Notebooks using PyMongo. The JSON files were hosted on separate Github repos to allow easy access to the data for website construction.
### Note! If you are attempting this project yourself given the data here, the two code lines you need to upload the cleaned CSVs are ```mongoimport --type csv -d national_parks -c parks_list --drop --headerline --file parks_list_cleaned.csv```, and ```mongoimport --type csv -d national_parks -c activities --drop --headerline --file activities.csv```.

# Website Outline

# Website Development

## WEBSITE Navigation 
- Once data was JSONified wireframes were created to contain the main navigation wiring, content containers, map containers, headers and footers. A main page was created as well as a main CSS for implementing color, styling and event specific handling, such as mozilla neglect. Once the main page was created other pages were created and modified to fit the page requirements. Images were created and added at this point. Once the page was built, functionality was added to populate the dropdowns, return map logic, reset the page and navigate away from the page. Other functionality was built such as background_logic.js and popup_logic.js to handle non-page specific requirements. 

* ROOT>

## WEBSITE Survey
#### Main index page
- This page is the main index of the site. The page is set up to loop through a carousel so you can pick how you want to search for the park. Additional functionality includes linking to the National Park Service through the logo and hypertext in the main navigation. The "Home", "About", and "Explore" offer links directly through this site. The home button directs you back to the index page, the about page presents a popup that talks about the project team, and the explore takes you to the directions page.

    </p>
<br>

- Once you have located a park, additional information is available in the popup. A shortened description turns into a full description when you click "read more", and the carats expand to go straight to the park website, look at the park activities, and use google maps to get directions to the park.

<br>

#### State page
- This page uses the dropdown to search a state and return a list of parks that are in that state. One note is that markers outside the state are trails that travel through the state, however the marker is showing you the main visitors center for the trail.

#### Directions page
- This page uses the map to search the listed parks. To use the directions, click open the popup for the park and click the bottom hyperlink. From there you can add your starting address above the populated container. The search button will return one or more options for driving directions to the park from your loaded destination.
